#+TITLE: SBCL Termux Build
This repository contains the script for  building SBCL on Android with Termux, as well as the prebuilt binary for ARM64.
* Requirement
Install ~zstd~ before getting started, which is required by ~SB-CORE-COMPRESSION~ after 2.2.6:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  apt-get install zstd
#+END_SRC
* Usage
Download and extract the prebuilt SBCL for Termux, which is available on the [[https://github.com/bohonghuang/sbcl-termux-build/releases][Release]] page:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  curl -OL "https://github.com/bohonghuang/sbcl-termux-build/releases/download/2.3.0/sbcl-2.3.0-arm64-termux.tar.zst"
  unzstd -c "sbcl-2.3.0-arm64-termux.tar.zst" | tar -xf -
  cd "sbcl-2.3.0"
#+END_SRC

Now you can run SBCL with:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sh run-sbcl.sh
#+END_SRC

If it runs without problems, install SBCL with:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  sh install.sh
#+END_SRC
